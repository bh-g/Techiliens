    <h1><b><center>Introduction</center></b></h1>
    <p style="font-size:120%" class="">C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension 
        of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now 
        has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is 
        almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software 
        Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.<br><br>
        C++ was designed with an orientation toward systems programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems, 
        with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights. C++ has also been found useful in many other 
        contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including desktop applications, 
        video games, servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search, or databases), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches 
        or space probes).</p>
