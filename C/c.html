    <p style="font-size:120%" class="">C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming,
         lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical
          machine instructions. It has found lasting use in applications previously coded in assembly language. Such applications include 
          operating systems and various application software for computer architectures that range from supercomputers to PLCs and embedded
           systems. <br><br>
           A successor to the programming language B, C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to
            construct utilities running on Unix. It was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system. During the
             1980s, C gradually gained popularity. It has become one of the most widely used programming languages, with C compilers
              from various vendors available for the majority of existing computer architectures and operating systems. C has been 
              standardized by ANSI since 1989 (ANSI C) and by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).</p><br><br>
