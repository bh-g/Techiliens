    <h1><b><center>Introduction</center></b></h1><br>
    <p style="font-size:120%" class="">Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have 
        as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write 
        once, run anywhere, meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.<br><br> 
        Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine regardless of the underlying 
        computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. 
        The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not 
        available in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use 
        according to GitHub,[19][20] particularly for clientâ€“server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.</p>
